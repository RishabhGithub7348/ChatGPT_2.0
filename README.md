## Project Overview

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. It is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server, follow these steps:

 Clone the repository:

 Navigate to the project's directory:
  cd ChatGPT_2.0
  
 Install the dependencies:
 ```bash
 npm run dev
 # or
 yarn dev
 # or
 pnpm dev
 ```

 Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The project includes an endpoint at http://localhost:3000/api/hello that uses Route Handlers. You can edit this endpoint in app/api/hello/route.ts.

The project also utilizes next/font to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.
